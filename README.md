# Untangle
Amiga port of a popular logic game.
## The Game
Untangle is a logic puzzle, where the player faces a set of dots connected by lines. Usually the set is untidy, many lines cross another ones. The game goal is to untangle lines by moving dots, so finally no line cross another.
## Project Goals
* Game should be system friendly, working in a window on Workbench, using only documented APIs.
* Minimum system version is 3.0.
* RTG (graphic cards) should be supported out of the box. Without dedicated code paths and explicit opening of RTG libraries, if possible.
* Would be nice if it works on MorphOS, AmigaOS 4, AROS using M68k emulation built into these operating systems.
* Should be comfortably playable on stock A1200, stock A500 is not a Holy Grail, but why not.
